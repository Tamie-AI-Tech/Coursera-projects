# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. MATLAB
# 5. Julia

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. NumPy
# 2. Pandas
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. Scikit-learn
# 5. TensorFlow

# ## Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# - a = 2
# - b = 3
# - c = 4
# - d = (a * b) + c
# - print(d)  # Output: 10
# 

# In[2]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3*4) + 5
print(result)  # Output: 17


#In this code, we use parentheses to control the order of evaluation and ensure that the multiplication is performed before the addition. 
#The comment line explains the purpose of the code and makes it easier for other developers to understand what the code is doing. 
#When you run this code cell, 
#it should output the result 17, which is the expected value of the expression.


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335

#In this code, we use the division operator (/) to convert the number of minutes to hours.
#The comment line explains the purpose of the code and makes it easier for other developers to understand what the code is doing. 
#When you run this code cell, it should output the result 3.3333333333333335, which is the expected value of 200 minutes in hours.
